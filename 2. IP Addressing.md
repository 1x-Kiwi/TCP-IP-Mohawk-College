## Objectives
- Describe IP addressing structures, and addresses from a computer's point of view
- Recognize and describe:
	- IPv4 addressing
	- address classes
	- IPv4 address limitations
## Addressing Basics
There are three levels of addressing for a computer using TCP/IP:
- **Physical Address**
	- Burned into firmware of the network interface card (NIC) at the factory
	- Defined at Layer 2
	- Normally not modifiable
	- Can sometimes be configures to another value (if it is a virtual machine, for example)
	- There is also MAC address spoofing
	- Expressed in hexadecimal
		- Example:
			- 00-C0-4F-76-82-8A
	- The first half is the vendor code, and the second half is akin to a similar number
- **Logical Numeric**
	- Assigned software address (changes on different networks)
	- IPv4 or IPv6
	- There should be no duplicate IP addresses on the LAN
	- One computer can have multiple addresses
- **Symbolic address**
	- Names such as mohawkcollege.ca, called domain names
	- Linked to a logical numeric address (IP address)
## Check out your Physical Address
- Open a Command window on your computer
- Type this in:
	- ***ipconfig /all*** 
		- This will display all the addressing information for your computer
		- Look for your *Physical Address* is should look similar to this: 74-D0-2B-90-05-3A
- Open a Command window on your computer
- Type this in:
	- ***ipconfig***
		- This will display all the addressing information for your computer
		- Look for your *IPv4 Address*
		- It should look like this: 142.222.70.12
		- ***NOTE: The college computers have more than one IP address (IPv4 and IPv6). This is referred to as dual-stacking.***
## How IPv4 addresses are assigned
- Statically
	- Set manually by the administrator
- Dynamically
	- Set automatically by a DHCP server
## The IPv4 Address
- IPv4 addresses are 4- octets(8 bits) of binary numbers which results in a potential address space of 2^32 (4,294,967,296) numbers
- IPv4 addresses are normally written in dotted decimal notation
- 10001110 11011110 00010011 00011111
	- 142 . 222 . 19 . 31
- The largest number in any octet expressed in decimal form is 255.
## Intro to IPv6 address format
- IPv6 addresses are normally written in a hexadecimal format that includes colons
- Example:
	- **2001:db8:0033:0000:0000:6666:0000:8888**
- Groups of zeroes can be removed from the address, but only one group at a time. Leading zeroes can also be removed.
## IPv4 Address Classes
- There are **FIVE** Address Classes
- The addresses commonly used to identify network nodes are:

| Class | Network Octets | Number Range | # of Networks | # of Hosts |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| A     | 1              | 1 - 126      | 126           | 16,777,214 |
| B     | 2              | 128 - 191    | 16,384        | 65,534     |
| C     | 3              | 192 - 223    | 2,097,152     | 254        |
## Address Classes
- Class D Addresses
	- Used for multicasting
	- Range: 224 - 239
- Class E Addresses
	- Used for experimental purposes
	- Range: 240 - 255
- The Missing Address
	- Addresses starting with 127 are used for diagnostic purposes
	- 127.0.0.1 is the loop back address, with symbolic name *localhost*
	- Also used for local communications
- The Address Rule
	- The IP addresses of the network ID, Subnet ID or Host ID should never consist of all ones or zeroes
- Broadcasts
	- 255.255.255.255 is the IP broadcast address
## IP Address Classes

| Class   | 8 bits  | 8 bits  | 8 bits  | 8 bits |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Class A | Network | Host    | Host    | Host   |
| Class B | Network | Network | Host    | Host   |
| Class C | Network | Network | Network | Host   |
## Classful Addressing - Special Addresses
- A Network address is represented by placing a zero in each of the host octets.
	- The class "A" address "10.x.x.x" is represented as "10.0.0.0"
	- The class "B" address "142.222.x.x" is represented as "142.222.0.0"
	- The class "C" address "195.143.1.x" is represented as "195.143.1.0"
- The **Network Broadcast IP address** is represented by all 1s
	- The network broadcast address for "10.0.0.0" (Network Address) 10.255.255.255
	- The network broadcast address for "142.222.0.0" (Network Address) 142.222.255.255
	- The network broadcast address for "195.143.1.0" (Network Address) 195.143.1.255
- All hosts on the physical network(LAN) will listen to packets with these network broadcasts addresses.
- It is ***important*** to note that broadcasts are typically ***not*** transmitted beyond the LAN
## Network Address and Broadcast Address - Example
- The network address is calculated by setting the 'host' portion of the address to it's minimum value (all bits off)
	- For example, in the college's Class B network (142.222.x.x)
	- We know that the network/host breakdown of a class B is:
		- NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH
		- 10001110.11011110.00000000.00000000
	- So the network address is: 142.222.0.0
- The broadcast address is calculated by setting the 'host' portion of the address to its maximum value (all bits on)
	- 10NNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH
	- 10001110.11011110.11111111.11111111
	- So the broadcast address it: 142.222.255.255
## Broadcast Packet Structures
- IPv4 broadcast packets have two destination address fields
	- Data Link layer destination address field (Layer 2)
		- ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 
	- Host portion of the address is set to all ones
		- 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 binary = 255 decimal
## IP Header Format
![[Pasted image 20250109201842.png]]
- Version
	- Either IPv4 or IPv6
- Length
	- Because IP datagrams contain a variable number of options, this is used to indicate when the actual data begins
- Type of Service (ToS)
	- Permits different datagram types. Used to determine level of service provided by the router.
- Total Length
	- Total lenght of the header plus the data
- Identification
	- Unique Packet ID for identifying the group of fragments of a single IP datagram
- Flags
	- Consists of a reserved bit (must be zero), do not fragment bit, and more fragments bit
- Fragment Offset
	- Represents the position of the fragment within the original fragmented IP packet
- Time to Live
	- When the IP datagram passes through a router, this is decremented by 1. When it reaches 0, the router will discard.
- Protocol
	- A value of 6 for TCP, and a value of 17 for UDP
- Header checksum
	- The receiver can use the checksum to check for errors
- Source Address
	- IP address of the device that originated the packet
- Destination Address
	- IP address of the device meant to receive the packet
- Options
	- Optional information such as source route. Not used often
## Private IPv4 Addresses
- Private IP addresses are a type of IP address that are meant to be used within a private (ex., Home, Corporate) network.
- Private IP address ranges are not routable over the Internet
	- This reduces risks from external threats.
- Class A
	- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
- Class B
	- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
- Class C
	- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
- Private IP address ranges are usually combined with NAT
## NAT - Network Address Translation
- Definition
	- NAT is a technique where IP addresses are translated form private (internal) addresses to public (external) addresses and vice versa.
- Purpose
	- Primarily used to allow multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet.
- Common Use
	- To conserve public IP addresses by using private IP address ranges
	- To improve network security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.
- Static NAT
	- One-to-one mapping between a private IP and a public IP
- Dynamic NAT
	- A private IP is mapped to a public IP from a pool of available public IPs.
- PAT (Port Address Translation)
	- Many private IPs share a single public IP, but each connection is tracked using unique port numbers (also known as "overloading"). This is the type of NAT that is most commonly used.
![[Pasted image 20250109202943.png]]
- How it works:
	- Translation Table
		- NAT maintains a mapping table to track active connections and their translations (e.g., which internal IP corresponds to which external IP and port).
	- Outgoing traffic:
		- Internal device sends a packet to the NAT device (usually a router). The NAT device modifies the packet, replacing the source IP with the router's public IP address.
	- Incoming Traffic:
		- The router receives data for the public IP and port, looks up the translation table, and forwards the packet to the correct internal device.
- Benefits:
	- IP address conversation
		- Reduces the need for large numbers of public IP addresses
	- Security:
		- Hides internal network structure, makin it harder for external users to attack.
	- Flexibility
		- Allows internal devices to connect to the internet without requiring a unique public IP for each
- Limitations
	- Complexity:
		- Can complicate certian protocols (like VoIP or online gaming) that need direct communication between devices
	- Performance:
		- Translation of packets introduces some processing overhead, especially with high traffic.
## Understanding Basic Binary Arithmetic
- You must master three different kinds of binary calculations
	- Converting binary to decimal
	- Converting decimal to binary
	- Understanding how setting increasing numbers of high-order bits to 1 contiguously is used to establish address masks
## Converting Decimal to Binary
- Simply divide the number by two, write the remainder (which **must** be 0 or 1), then write the dividend, and repeat until the dividend is zero
- To produce the binary number that corresponds to 125, you write the digits starting with the last remainder value, and work your way up

| number | div by | number | equals | number | remainder | number |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| 125    | div by | 2      | equals | 62     | remainder | 1      |
| 62     | div by | 2      | equals | 31     | remainder | 0      |
| 31     | div by | 2      | equals | 15     | remainder | 1      |
| 15     | div by | 2      | equals | 7      | remainder | 1      |
| 7      | div by | 2      | equals | 3      | remainder | 1      |
| 3      | div by | 2      | equals | 1      | remainder | 1      |
| 1      | div by | 2      | equals | 0      | remainder | 1      |
- This is extremely easy, if you know your powers of two
- Follow these steps, using 1111101 as the example number:
	- Count the total number of digits in the number (1111101 has seven digits)
	- Subtract one from the total (7-1=6). That is the power of two to associate with the highest exponent for two in the exponential notation for that number
	- Convert to exponential notation, using all the digits as multipliers
