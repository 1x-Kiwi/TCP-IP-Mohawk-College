## Objectives
- TCP/IP's origins and history
- Explain how TCP/IP standards and other documents, called Requests for Comments (RFCs), are established
- Introduce key protocols
- Explain the function and importance of the OSI Model
## What is TCP/IP?
- Large collection of network protocols and services
- Two key protocols
	- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
		- Management of the delivery of messages
	- Internet Protocol (IP)
		- Manages the routing of network transmissions and addressing of network nodes
## The Origins and History of TCP/IP
- 1969
	- Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded research for packet-switched networking
		- ARPANET
			- Network built as a result of this project
- In a packet-switched network
	- Sender and receiver are identified by unique network addresses
	- Packets are not required to follow the same path in transit
## TCP/IP's Design Goals
- To withstand a potential nuclear strike
- To permit different computer systems to communicate easily
- To interconnect systems across long distances
## Who "Owns" TCP/IP
- TCP/IP
	- Falls squarely into the public domain
	- Funded with public monies since its inception
	- Owned by everybody and nobody
	- Net Neutrality
		- All Traffic on the internet has the same priority and access
		- USA has changed the rules in 2018
		- Canada is studying this
## Standards Groups that oversee TCP/IP
- Internet Society (ISOC)
	- American nonprofit organization founded in 1992 to provide leadership in internet related standards, education, access, and policy.
- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
	- Short term issues of Engineering and standard making
	- Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
- Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)
	- Focuses on long term research support for the IETF
- Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
## Internet Engineering Task Force TCP/IP Standards and RFCs
- Request For Comments (RFCs)
	- Provide documentation to understand, implement, and use TCP/IP protocols
- Index for all RFCs available at:
	- www.faws.org/rfcs/
	- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149
	- *Check out rfc2549*
- RFC 2026
	- Describes how an RFC is created
## TCP/IP Suite - Key Protocols
- TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol
- UDP: Unreliable, connectionless transport protocol
- IP: Routing and addressing protocol (IPv4, IPv6)
- ARP: Address Resolution Protocol (resolves IP to MAC address)
- ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol (for network connectivity testing)
- DNS: Domain Name System (resolves domain names to IP addresses)
- HTTP/HTTPS,FTP,SMTP,IMAPetc.: More Application-layer protocols that are part of the TCP/IP suite
## TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
- Features of TCP: Reliability, flow control, congestion control
- Connection establishment (3-way handshake)
- Data transfer process (segmentation, sequencing, acknowledgment)
- Connection termination (4-way handshake)
- Examples: Web browsing, file transfers
## UDP - User Datagram Protocol
- Features of UDP: Lightweight, no connection setup, faster, no guarantees (unreliable)
- Use cases: Streaming, VoIP, DNS queries
- Provides none of the connection-oriented features of TCP
## IP - Internet Protocol
- Routing and forwarding: How data finds its way across networks
- Subnetting: Dividing networks into smaller subnetworks
- Classes of IP addresses: A, B, C, and special addresses (Loopback, Private IP ranges)
- Classless Inter-Domain Routing: Allows network routers to route data packets to the respective device based on the indicated subnet. Instead of classifying the IP address based on classes, routers retrieve the network and host address as specified by the subnet mask/CIDR suffix.
- Example of a CIDR Suffix: 192.168.100.1/24  (/24 is the suffix)
## IPv6 Advantages
- Larger Address Space
	- Example IPv6 Address:
		- 2001:db8:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
- Simplified Addressing and Routing
	- Reduces the complexity of routing tables, making routing more efficient
- No Need for NAT
	- Globally unique IP addresses eliminate the need for NAT, which complicates communication in IPv4.
## OSI Reference Model Overview
- OSI reference model
	- A network operations reference model
	- Designed to create a Standard way to explain how networks operate and communicate
	- TCP/IP follows the open standard protocol suite of choice
		- The OSI - Open Systems Interconnection model is an international Standard created by the:
			- ISO - International Organization for Standardization
## Breaking Networking into Layers
- Makes:
	- It **EASIER** to solve problems when broken into series of smaller problems
	- Allows **LAYERS** to operate independently of one another
	- Each layer can **act autonomously,** but must be able to **communicate** with it's adjacent layers
- Key points about networking
	- Individual layers work together on pairs of computers
	- Different functions are needed at each layer
	- Layers in a network implementation work together to facilitate communications across the network
	- Network protocols usually map into one or more layers
	- TCP/IP is designed around a layered model
## The ISO/OSI Network Reference Model Layers

| Layer NO. | Layer Name            |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 7         | Application           |
| 6         | Presentaion           |
| 5         | Session               |
| 4         | Transport             |
| 3         | Network               |
| 2         | Data Link MAC and LLC |
| 1         | Physical              |

## How Protocol Layers Behave
- Layers
	- Exist to encapsulate or isolate specific types of functionality
	- Provide services to the layer above
	- Deliver data to or accept data from the layer below
- Protocol Data Units (PDUs)
	- Include "envelope information" in the form of specific headers and trailers
## Layer 1 - Physical
- Includes the physical transmission medium
- Job is to activate, maintain, and deactivate network connections
- Manages communications with the network medium going down the protocol stack
- Handles conversion of outgoing data
## Layer 2 - Data Link
- Situated between the Physical layer (Layer 1) and the Network Layer (Layer 3) in the reference model
- Job is to:
	- Enable reliable transmission of data through the Physical layer at the sending and Check reliability at the receiving end
- Manages point-to-point transmission across the networking medium
- Divided into two sub-layers:
	- MAC - Media Access Control
	- LLC - Logical Link Control
## Layer 3 - Network
- Handles logical addresses associated with individual machines on a network
- Uses addressing information to:
	- Determine how to send a PDU
- Embodies notion of multiple simultaneous connections between different IP addresses
- Flexible enough to:
	- Recognize and use multiple routes between a sender and receiver
## Layer 4 - Transport
- Ensures reliable end-to-end transmission of PDUs
- Includes end-to-end error-detection and error-recovery
- Segmentation
	- Involves cutting up a big message into numberd sequence of chunks, called *segments*
- PDUs used at the Transport layer are called *segments*, or *data segments*
## Layer 5 - Session
- Defines mechanisms to:
	- Permit senders and receivers to request that a conversation start or stop
	- Keep a conversation going even when traffic may not otherwise flow between the parties involved
- Checkpoints
	- Define the last point up to which successful communications are known t have occurred
## Layer 6 - Presentation
- Handles transforming data from:
	- Generic, network-oriented forms of expression to more specific, platform-oriented forms of expression
- A re-director or network shell
	- Special computer facility that resides here
- Can supply special data-handling functions for applications
## Layer 7 - Application
- Defines an interface that applications can use to request network services
- Defines a set of access controls over the network
- PDUs
	- Generically called "*Application PDUs*"
## TCP/IP Model Layers

	- QUIC is a newer transport layer protocol developed by Google
	- QUIC is the foundation of HTTP/3, the next generation of the HTTP protocol, where QUIC replaces TCP
- The impact of emerging technologies on networking (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), etc.)
## Future of TCP/IP - Internet of Things
- Definition: IoT refers to the network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data over the internet.
- IoT enables everyday objects (e.g.c home appliances, wearable's, vehicles, industrial machines) to communicate with each other and with control systems or the cloud.
- IoT allows for remote monitoring, management, and control of devices, often through smartphones or web platforms (e.g., smart thermostats, lighting systems).
